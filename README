Tasks
=====

Tasks is task-tracking tool for individuals and small groups of people.  The initial code was lifted directly from Jan Lehnardt's "Programming CouchDB with Javascript" blog post [1] when I was attempting to understand how programming for CouchDB would work.

The final product will include the following features:

- adding tasks from a simple text interface
- inline task editing
- task sorting
- task deleting
- task completion
- assigning tasks to yourself and others
